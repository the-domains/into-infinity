<p>After listening to <strong><a href="http://bit.ly/JoeRoganKeto">Joe Rogan’s interview with Mark Sisson</a></strong>, and more recently to<strong><a href="http://bit.ly/TimFerrissKeto">Tim Ferriss’ podcast with Dom D’Agostino</a></strong> on the power of the ketogenic diet, I was inspired. Here was a dietary lifestyle that would effectively provide a ‘reset’ to the body in many ways: re-calibrate your insulin response, encourage weight loss, decrease food cravings, decrease inflammation, stroke prevention, improved memory and cognitive benefits, and plenty of other benefits.</p><h2><strong>WHAT?</strong></h2><p>So what exactly is ketosis and what does it mean to be in a state of ketosis? Well, we’ve got to start at the beginning and have a basic understanding how energy gets used by the body. (By the way, I have no credentials in this field academically or professionally, so please excuse any technical errors. This is literally based on what I’ve read / heard about the topic until now).</p><p>Most of us rely on the glycogen in our blood for energy, which is derived from sugar. Excess sugar in our bodies is readily stored in our muscles, to be used. When it isn’t (and if there’s any excess), it gets tucked away as fat.</p><p>Now when one is in the metabolic state of ketosis, the body turns to fat as its primary energy source. It breaks down the fat into ketones, which becomes the main fuel for the body and brain.</p><h2><strong>HOW?</strong></h2><p>And how does one get in to that metabolic state? In a nutshell, your diet pre-dominantly consists of (healthy) fats, moderate protein, and minimal carbohydrates. It’s important to reach the appropriate levels in this ratio, so as to drive the body into a state of ketosis. This process can take apparently anywhere from a couple of weeks to months (variables include the amount of sugar in your body now, activity level, your diet, etc.)</p><p>What does that actually mean, in terms of numbers? I’ve read that the carbohydrate intake for the day ranges anywhere from 20 grams to 50 grams per day (yet no more). I found <strong><a href="http://bit.ly/29SLHXm">this </a></strong>website super helpful in calculating the daily macros. Just plug in your basic body stat (height, weight, etc.), your activity level, and it calculates your basal metabolic rate (in other words, how many calories your body needs to burn to just keep you alive throughout the day). You then select your desired goals and bam, out comes the macros at the end. </p><h2><strong>OK, BUT, REALLY – HOW?</strong></h2><p>Yeah, good question. It requires constant awareness of what goes down the chute and keeping track of it. The awareness part for me is, admittedly, lacking, which is why I now use <strong><a href="http://bit.ly/2a52zhT">Lifesum </a></strong>to keep track of everything. Handy app that has a pretty expansive database, and uses a barcode scanner for quick entries that doesn’t require you to waste time searching around.</p><p>Other tools at my disposal would be keeping a diary – I’ve started an online<strong><a href="http://bit.ly/StephensJournal">training diary</a></strong> at <strong><a href="http://exrx.net/index.html">ExRx.net</a></strong> – I update the diary most (week) days, primarily for my own accountability.</p><p>So this sounds pretty achievable, right?</p><p>Things is, until very recently, I was a vegetarian who didn’t have milk products but ate eggs. I would regularly eat quinoa, lentils, chickpeas, and beans with a very wide variety of vegetables. Whole grains were a part of my diet (in Norway, there’s something called knekkebrød that I would usually eat, whole wheat pasta, brown rice, etc.)</p><p>When I decided to give a crash go at going keto, giving up whole grains was the easy part. The hard part, was striking off the quinoa, legumes, nuts, and some of the vegetables. When I had a diet revolve around eggs and avocados (primarily), I felt miserable as fuck.</p><p>So now that I wish to approach this with more sensibility, have donned the cape of a pescetarian – aka, one who eats veggies but also fish. Also introduced cheese back into my life (to the cheese, I say <em>ohthankgodyoutastesogood</em>).</p><p>Given that I’ll be ingesting some veggies which may contain more carbs than I intend, am also planning on integrating intermittent fasting into the mix – a 6 hour restricted eating window – along with a twice a week / water fast. The time restricted eating window, along with the fasting should help bring me closer to the state of ketosis by working the glycogen out of my system.</p><h2><strong>OK MAN, BUT WHEN?</strong></h2><p>I’ll start this on Friday, July 29th 2016 (it coincides with my wife taking my son to visit family back home for about 12 days), so will allow me to hone in on myself and be a real stickler.</p><p>Hmm… anything else worth adding here? *<em>mentally scratches head. </em>Guess that’s it. Not bad for a first post. If anyone happens to stumble across this, comments would be more than welcome.</p><h1><strong>LET’S DO THIS.</strong></h1><p>SR.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-black colors-local " data-reactid="19"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="20"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="21"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="22"><span data-reactid="23"><!-- react-empty: 24 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="25"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="26">LET’S DO THIS.</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="27"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="29"></div></div></div></section></div></div>

The five weights with matching italics make Open Sans extremely versatile and useful for a wide range of applications. It is a ubiquitous font on the web, used by everyone from Google to WordPress. I’ve even heard it referred to as the “flat design” font. I like to think of Open Sans as the new Arial."}},"styles":"html { font-family: '-apple-system', '.SFNSText-Regular', 'San Francisco', 'Roboto', 'Segoe UI', 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande', 'sans-serif';font-weight: 400;
