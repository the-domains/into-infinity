This morning, I woke up on the couch in my office. The first time I've ever slept at my office (and now, the last). I thought it made sense to stay late yesterday evening to catch up on 'red-activities' (read: outstanding activities that need to get done) since my wife and son we're out of town travelling anyway, I thought why not get some stuff done?

Bad idea.

I ended up working until 11:30pm, calling prospects and clients, only to fall asleep on an uncomfortable couch, wake up every 2 hours disoriented, with stale air to breathe. Nasty.

And then a familiar quote entered my head. One of my favorites, as a matter of fact, comes from Mr. Bruce Lee:

# If you always put limits on everything you do, physical or anything else, it will spread into your work and into your life. There are no limits. There are only plateaus, and you must not stay there, you must go beyond them.

What I like most about the quote is the background behind it. From Bruce's book [The Art of Expressing the Human Body][0], a story is shared by a training partner of his, John Little: 

_"Bruce had me up to three miles a day, really at a good pace. We'd run the three miles in twenty-one or twenty-two minutes. Just under eight minutes a mile \[Note: when running on his own in 1968, Lee would get his time down to six-and-a half minutes per mile\]._

_So this morning he said to me "We're going to go five." I said, "Bruce, I can't go five. I'm a helluva lot older than you are, and I can't do five." He said, "When we get to three, we'll shift gears and it's only two more and you'll do it." I said "Okay, hell, I'll go for it."_

_So we get to three, we go into the fourth mile and I'm okay for three or four minutes, and then I really begin to give out. I'm tired, my heart's pounding, I can't go any more and so I say to him, "Bruce if I run any more," --and we're still running- "if I run any more I'm liable to have a heart attack and die." He said, "Then die." It made me so mad that I went the full five miles._

_Afterward I went to the shower and then I wanted to talk to him about it. I said, you know, "Why did you say that?" He said, "Because you might as well be dead. Seriously, if you always put limits on what you can do, physical or anything else, it'll spread over into the rest of your life. It'll spread into your work, into your morality, into your entire being. There are no limits. There are plateaus, but you must not stay there, you must go beyond them. If it kills you, it kills you. A man must constantly exceed his level."_

If we aren't dedicated to growth or expansion, if we aren't willing to step outside the comfort zone we've created for ourselves in the day to day hum-drum of life, then yeah, we might as well be dead.

Staying overnight at work, thinking you're going to be productive isn't exactly what he meant by going beyond one's limits, I believe. That's just poor planning and time management.

Am happy that quote floated to the front of my mind this morning. All the more reason to end this day much earlier than I thought and get some badly needed fresh air.

Bruce Lee, for the win.
